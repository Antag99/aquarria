#Aquarria
An attempt to recreate [Terraria](http://terraria.org/) in Java, using [libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) as the
game development framework. It is a work-in-progress, but some features are already implemented. It works by extracting
Terraria's assets on first launch and moving them around a bit. The goal is to provide an alternate version of Terraria
that is more maintainable and open sourcier than the original.
