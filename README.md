#Aquarria
An attempt to recreate [Terraria](http://terraria.org/) in Java, using [libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) as the
game development framework. It is a work-in-progress, but some features are already implemented. It works by extracting
Terraria's assets on first launch, and then processing them to a more suitable format. Java 8 is required, as it has many
new cool features, and the game wouldn't suit a phone in the near future. The goal is to provide an alternate version of
Terraria that is more maintainable and open sourcier than the original.
